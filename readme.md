# Stream Music Over Wi-Fi

## Overview
This project solves a common issue with Bluetooth speakers: **limited range**.  
If I'm playing music from my phone on a Bluetooth speaker and move too
far away, the audio gets distorted or disconnects.  

To fix this, I will use **Wi-Fi**, which has a much greater range than Bluetooth.

## How It Works
- The **laptop** stays near the **Bluetooth speaker**, acting as a relay.
- The **phone** and **laptop** connect to the same Wi-Fi network.
- **Audio streams** from the phone to the laptop over Wi-Fi.
- The laptop forwards the audio to the Bluetooth speaker.

This way, I can move freely while keeping my phone connected to the audio system.

The phone will be the server and the laptop will be the client.
There are two directories, one for the server and one for the client.
More information on them is found in the readme files found in the
directories.

## Features (Planned)
- **Stream music over Wi-Fi** instead of Bluetooth.  
- **Support multiple speakers** via multiple laptops.  
- **Stream to another phone** instead of a laptop.  
- **Stream microphone audio** instead of music.  

## Installation & Usage
*This project is still in development. Setup instructions will be added soon.*  

## Future Plans
I might experiment with:
- Multi-room audio streaming.
- Directly sending audio to smart speakers.
- Real-time low-latency streaming improvements.

## Contributions
Ideas and contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an **issue** or **pull request**.
